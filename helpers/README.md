# Helper Utilities

This directory contains helper notebooks and utilities for the PLCA grid expansion analysis.

## Contents

- `iam_results_decryption.ipynb`: Tools for decrypting premise IAM result files
  - Contains code to decrypt premise IAM results that include generation shares of different technologies in electricity mixes
  - **Note**: Requires a decryption key from premise maintainers
